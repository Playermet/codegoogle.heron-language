#summary Overview of Modules in Heron.
#labels Phase-Design

= Modules =

A module is a named package of type definitions. It may contains classes, interfaces, and enums. A file can contain only one module. Every program consists of at least one module. A Heron script maps to a module.  

A module has the following layout:

{{{
module MyModule
{
  class SomeClass 
  {
  }
 
  interface SomeInterface
  {
  }
  
  enum SomeEnum
  {
  }
} 
}}}

= Implementation Details =

The implementation of modules can be found in the file HeronModule.cs.  

= To do =

The module design is not complete yet. The details of how to handle exports and imports still have to be done.
