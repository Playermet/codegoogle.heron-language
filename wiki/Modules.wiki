= Modules =

A module is a named package of type definitions. It may contains classes, interfaces, and enums. A file can contain only one module. A module has the following layout:

{{{
module MyModule
{
  class SomeClass 
  {
  }
 
  interface SomeInterface
  {
  }
  
  enum SomeEnum
  {
  }
} 
}}}

= To do =

The module design is not complete yet. The details of how to handle exports and imports still have to be done.
