#summary Static data in Heron.

= Static Data and Module Variables =

In Heron there is no static data, instead module variables are used. Each class instance is associated with a particular module instance. All class instances associated with a particular module instance have access to the same data.

This is similar in behavior to global state, but the difference is that a module can be instantiated multiple times.    

This is an idea which was inspired by [http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/02/cutting-out-static.html this post by Gilad Bracha] the author of the [http://newspeaklanguage.org/ Newspeak] language.
