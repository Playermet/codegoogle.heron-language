#summary Overview of Heron scripts.

= Scripts =

A Heron script is syntactic sugar for a module with a single class. It is intended to make it easier to write small programs, and to reuse them in larger programs.

A script entry point is a function named `Main()`. 

A script has the following form:

{{{
script MyScript;

var x = 10;

Main() {
  foreach (i in 0..x)
    Console.WriteLine(i.ToString());
}
}}}

The previous example is equivalent to the following program:

{{{
module MyScript
{
  class Main
  {
    fields 
    {
      x : Any;
    }
    methods 
    {
       Constructor() {
         foreach (i in 0..x)
           Console.WriteLine(i.ToString());
       }
    }
  }
}
}}}

= Implementation Details =

The conversion from a script to Module is done in the file HeronTypedAST.cs.
